# Implementation Lead - Secure API Key Storage System

## Task Completion Summary

### Delivered Components

1. **Core Secure Storage Module** (`secure_storage.py`)
   - AES-GCM encryption with 256-bit keys
   - PBKDF2 key derivation (100,000 iterations)
   - Secure file operations with restrictive permissions
   - Master key management via environment variables

2. **Configuration Management System** (`config_manager.py`)
   - Multi-profile support for different environments
   - Support for multiple API providers
   - Environment variable management
   - Import/export functionality

3. **Key Rotation Capabilities** (`key_rotation.py`)
   - Automated rotation based on expiry
   - Manual rotation with rollback support
   - Complete audit trail
   - Provider-specific rotation callbacks

4. **Command Line Interface** (`cli.py`)
   - User-friendly commands for all operations
   - Profile management
   - Key rotation and monitoring
   - Export/import for backup

5. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Complete usage examples (`example_usage.py`)
   - Requirements file for dependencies
   - Implementation documentation

### Security Architecture Implemented

Since the Security Architect's design was not available, I implemented industry-standard security practices:

1. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for authenticated encryption
2. **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with salt
3. **Access Control**: Unix file permissions (0o600/0o700)
4. **Audit Logging**: Complete operation history
5. **Key Rotation**: Automated and manual with rollback
6. **No Plaintext**: Keys never stored unencrypted

### Usage Instructions

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set master key:
   ```bash
   export API_KEY_MASTER="your-secure-master-key"
   ```

3. Use CLI for operations:
   ```bash
   ./cli.py --help
   ```
