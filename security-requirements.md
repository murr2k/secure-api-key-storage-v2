# API Key Storage Security Requirements

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the security requirements for storing API keys for GitHub, Claude, and other third-party services in a secure manner.

## 2. Security Objectives
- **Confidentiality**: API keys must be encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Integrity**: Detect any unauthorized modifications to stored keys
- **Availability**: Authorized users/applications must be able to access keys when needed
- **Non-repudiation**: Audit trail of all key access and modifications

## 3. Threat Model

### 3.1 Threats to Consider
- **T1**: Unauthorized access to storage location
- **T2**: Memory dumps exposing keys
- **T3**: Man-in-the-middle attacks during key retrieval
- **T4**: Insider threats with system access
- **T5**: Malware attempting to steal keys
- **T6**: Social engineering attacks
- **T7**: Supply chain attacks on dependencies

### 3.2 Attack Vectors
- File system access
- Process memory inspection
- Network interception
- Backup file exposure
- Configuration file leaks
- Environment variable exposure

## 4. Security Requirements

### 4.1 Encryption Requirements
- **REQ-ENC-001**: All API keys MUST be encrypted using AES-256-GCM
- **REQ-ENC-002**: Encryption keys MUST be derived using PBKDF2 with minimum 100,000 iterations
- **REQ-ENC-003**: Each API key MUST have a unique initialization vector (IV)
- **REQ-ENC-004**: Master encryption key MUST never be stored in plaintext

### 4.2 Access Control Requirements
- **REQ-ACC-001**: Implement principle of least privilege for key access
- **REQ-ACC-002**: Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- **REQ-ACC-003**: Role-based access control (RBAC) for key management
- **REQ-ACC-004**: Time-based access restrictions where applicable

### 4.3 Storage Requirements
- **REQ-STO-001**: Keys MUST NOT be stored in version control systems
- **REQ-STO-002**: Storage location MUST have restricted file permissions (600 on Unix)
- **REQ-STO-003**: Implement secure deletion when keys are removed
- **REQ-STO-004**: Support for hardware security modules (HSM) or secure enclaves

### 4.4 Auditing Requirements
- **REQ-AUD-001**: Log all key access attempts (success and failure)
- **REQ-AUD-002**: Maintain tamper-proof audit logs
- **REQ-AUD-003**: Alert on suspicious access patterns
- **REQ-AUD-004**: Regular security audits and key rotation

### 4.5 Key Lifecycle Requirements
- **REQ-LCY-001**: Implement key rotation policies (90-day maximum)
- **REQ-LCY-002**: Secure key generation using cryptographically secure random sources
- **REQ-LCY-003**: Key versioning and rollback capabilities
- **REQ-LCY-004**: Secure key destruction with cryptographic erasure

## 5. Compliance Requirements
- **REQ-COM-001**: Comply with relevant data protection regulations (GDPR, CCPA)
- **REQ-COM-002**: Follow industry standards (NIST, OWASP)
- **REQ-COM-003**: Support compliance reporting and attestation

## 6. Performance Requirements
- **REQ-PER-001**: Key retrieval latency < 100ms
- **REQ-PER-002**: Support for caching with secure cache invalidation
- **REQ-PER-003**: Minimal performance impact on applications

## 7. Disaster Recovery Requirements
- **REQ-DRR-001**: Encrypted backups with separate key management
- **REQ-DRR-002**: Key recovery procedures with proper authorization
- **REQ-DRR-003**: Regular backup testing and validation
