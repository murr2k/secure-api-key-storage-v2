# Security Architect Agent - API Key Storage Design Summary

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive security architecture for storing API keys (GitHub, Claude, and other services) with enterprise-grade security. The design implements defense-in-depth principles with multiple layers of protection.

## Key Security Decisions

### 1. Encryption Strategy
- **Algorithm**: AES-256-GCM (authenticated encryption)
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with 100,000 iterations minimum
- **Alternative**: Argon2id for enhanced resistance against GPU attacks
- **Key Size**: 256-bit encryption keys
- **IV/Nonce**: 128-bit random values per encryption operation

### 2. Storage Architecture
| Environment | Primary Storage | Backup Option | Security Level |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------|----------------|
| Development | OS Keychain | Encrypted SQLite | High |
| Production | Cloud KMS | HSM | Very High |
| CI/CD | Vault/Secrets Manager | Encrypted Config | High |
| Local | SQLCipher | Encrypted Backup | Medium-High |

### 3. Access Control
- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Session Management**: 15-minute timeout with activity tracking
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 requests per minute per user

### 4. Key Lifecycle
- **Generation**: Cryptographically secure random generation
- **Rotation**: Mandatory 90-day rotation policy
- **Versioning**: Support for multiple key versions during rotation
- **Destruction**: Cryptographic erasure with secure memory wiping

## Critical Security Requirements

### Must-Have Features
1. **Encryption at rest** - All keys encrypted before storage
2. **Authenticated encryption** - Prevent tampering with stored keys
3. **Secure key derivation** - Protection against brute force attacks
4. **Audit logging** - Complete trail of all key operations
5. **Memory protection** - Prevent key exposure in memory dumps
6. **Access control** - Granular permissions for key operations

### Security Controls
1. **Input validation** - Prevent injection attacks
2. **Rate limiting** - Prevent brute force attempts
3. **Anti-debugging** - Protection against runtime analysis
4. **Secure communication** - TLS 1.3 for all network traffic
5. **Error handling** - No information leakage in error messages
6. **Backup encryption** - Separate encryption for backups

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Security (Week 1-2)
- [ ] Implement AES-256-GCM encryption
- [ ] Create PBKDF2 key derivation
- [ ] Build local encrypted storage
- [ ] Implement basic authentication

### Phase 2: Access Control (Week 3-4)
- [ ] Add RBAC system
- [ ] Implement MFA support
- [ ] Create audit logging
- [ ] Add rate limiting

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)
- [ ] Cloud KMS integration

- [ ] Memory protection
- [ ] Anti-debugging measures

### Phase 4: Production Hardening (Week 7-8)
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Monitoring integration
- [ ] Documentation completion

## Quick Reference: Security Checklist

### Before Storing a Key
- [ ] User authenticated with MFA?
- [ ] Permission to create/update keys?
- [ ] Within rate limits?
- [ ] Valid key format?
- [ ] Audit log ready?

### During Storage
- [ ] Generate unique IV/nonce
- [ ] Use authenticated encryption
- [ ] Include metadata in AAD
- [ ] Set rotation schedule
- [ ] Log the operation

### After Storage
- [ ] Clear key from memory
- [ ] Update audit log
- [ ] Set key permissions
- [ ] Schedule rotation reminder
- [ ] Backup if required

### Key Retrieval
- [ ] Verify authentication
- [ ] Check authorization
- [ ] Validate session
- [ ] Decrypt securely
- [ ] Log access

## Security Architecture Highlights

### Encryption Flow
```
Password → PBKDF2 (100k) → Master Key → AES-256-GCM → Encrypted Key
                ↑                            ↑
               Salt                         IV + AAD
```

### Trust Boundaries
1. **User Input** → Validation Layer (untrusted)
2. **Validation** → Authentication (semi-trusted)
3. **Authentication** → Crypto Operations (trusted)
4. **Crypto** → Secure Storage (highly trusted)

### Defense Layers
1. **Network**: TLS 1.3, certificate pinning
2. **Application**: Input validation, RBAC
3. **Cryptographic**: AES-256-GCM, HMAC
4. **Storage**: Encrypted at rest, access controls
5. **Runtime**: Memory protection, anti-debug

## Technology Recommendations

### Recommended Stack
- **Language**: Python with `cryptography` library or Rust with `ring`
- **Storage**: SQLCipher for local, AWS KMS for cloud
- **Authentication**: TOTP/HOTP with pyotp
- **Audit**: Structured logging with immutable storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards

### Avoid These
- ❌ Storing keys in environment variables
- ❌ Using weak encryption (< 256-bit)
- ❌ Implementing custom crypto
- ❌ Storing keys in version control
- ❌ Using MD5 or SHA1 for key derivation
- ❌ Plaintext backups

## Compliance Alignment

### Standards Met
- **NIST SP 800-57**: Key management recommendations
- **OWASP ASVS 4.0**: Level 3 compliance
- **PCI DSS**: Cryptographic key storage requirements
- **GDPR**: Data protection by design
- **SOC 2**: Security controls for service organizations

### Audit Requirements
- Immutable audit logs
- 90-day retention minimum
- Real-time alerting
- Regular security reviews
- Penetration testing

## Integration Examples

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Store a key
secure-keys add --name github_token --mfa 123456

# Retrieve a key (copies to clipboard)
secure-keys get --name github_token

# Rotate a key
secure-keys rotate --name github_token
```

### API Usage
```python
from secure_keys import KeyManager

km = KeyManager()
km.authenticate(password, mfa_token)

# Store
km.store_key("github_token", api_key_value)

# Retrieve
api_key = km.get_key("github_token")
```
