## Bugs Found and Fixed

### Bug 1: ConfigurationManager Initialization
- **Issue**: Missing required `config_path` parameter in backend initialization
- **Fix**: Updated `dashboard/backend/main.py` to provide config path parameter
- **Impact**: Resolved import errors and enabled proper configuration management

### Bug 2: Relative Import Issues
- **Issue**: `secure_storage_rbac.py` used incorrect relative imports
- **Fix**: Updated imports to use proper relative import syntax (`.` prefix)
- **Impact**: Resolved module import failures across the system

### Bug 3: Missing Compatibility Methods
- **Issue**: RBAC storage class missing wrapper methods for dashboard compatibility
- **Fix**: Added `update_key`, `verify_master_password`, and fixed method signatures
- **Impact**: Enabled seamless integration between RBAC system and dashboard API

### Bug 4: Refresh Token API Format
- **Issue**: Refresh token endpoint expected different request format than tests provided
- **Fix**: Updated endpoint to accept JSON request body with `RefreshTokenRequest` model
- **Impact**: Fixed authentication token refresh functionality

### Bug 5: NoneType Description Handling
- **Issue**: Search functionality failed when key descriptions were None
- **Fix**: Added null-safe handling for description field in search logic
- **Impact**: Prevented crashes during key search operations

### Bug 6: Key Rotation Parameter Mismatch
- **Issue**: Rotation manager expected different parameters than provided
- **Fix**: Updated to use storage's rotate_key method instead of rotation manager
- **Impact**: Fixed key rotation functionality in the API

### Bug 7: Middleware Import Issues
- **Issue**: Middleware imports failed when running from different directories
- **Fix**: Added fallback import paths and graceful degradation
- **Impact**: Improved system resilience and testability

## Test Architecture
