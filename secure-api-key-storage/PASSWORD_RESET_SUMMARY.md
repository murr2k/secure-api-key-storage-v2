### What Was Changed
1. **Environment Files Updated**:

     - JWT_SECRET_KEY
     - ENCRYPTION_KEY
     - GRAFANA_PASSWORD

2. **Encrypted Keys Cleared**:
   - All existing encrypted API keys were cleared (cannot be decrypted with new password)
   - File: `/keys/encrypted_keys.json` - Now empty with reset metadata

3. **Backups Created**:
   - Location: `/backups/reset_20250711_204131/`
   - Contains backups of all critical files before reset

### Docker Services Status

  - ✅ Backup service (running)
  - ⚠️ Main application (running but API not responding)

### Known Issues
- The main application container is running but the API is not responding on port 8000
- This may be due to startup issues or permission problems

### Next Steps
1. **Access the Web Interface**:
   - URL: http://localhost:3000
   - Login with password: `SecureApiKey2025!`

2. **Re-add API Keys**:
   - All previously stored API keys need to be re-added
   - Use the web interface or API to add new keys

3. **Troubleshooting the API**:
   - Check logs: `docker logs secure-key-storage -f`
   - Restart container: `docker restart secure-key-storage`
   - Check process: `docker exec secure-key-storage ps aux`

### Security Notes

- Ensure the new password is stored securely
- Consider updating the password to something more secure in production
- All services are using proper authentication with the configured passwords
