  "how_integrated": "RBAC is deeply integrated into the existing system:\n    \n    1. Enhanced Storage Layer:\n       - SecureStorageWithRBAC extends APIKeyStorage\n       - All key operations now check permissions\n       - User context required for all operations\n    \n    2. API Layer Integration:\n       - JWT-based authentication replaces master password\n       - All endpoints protected with permission checks\n       - Per-request user context via Depends(get_current_user)\n    \n    3. Database Integration:\n       - Separate SQLite database for RBAC (rbac.db)\n       - Links to existing key storage via key_id\n       - Maintains audit trail of all operations\n    \n    4. Migration Support:\n       - migrate_to_rbac.py script for existing systems\n       - Preserves all existing keys and metadata\n       - Creates users for existing key owners\n    \n    5. Dashboard Updates:\n       - New user management interface\n       - Key sharing capabilities\n       - Role-based UI elements\n       - Real-time audit log streaming",
